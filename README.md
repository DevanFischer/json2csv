# json2csv
### A Github Action Automation Example

This project demonstrates how to set up an automated github action that runs when branch 'X' receives a push. 

The workflow reads the repository files and calls the script json2csv.sh. The script loops over some json files in a directory and converts them to csv files in a new directory.
